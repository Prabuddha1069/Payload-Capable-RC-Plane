# Manual RC Plane with Payload

This repository contains the design and build instructions for a manual RC plane capable of carrying a payload. The plane is controlled using a FlySky transmitter and receiver, and powered by a BLDC motor with servo motors for control surfaces. The body of the plane is made with Depron.

## Introduction

This project documents the process of building a manual RC plane with a payload. The plane uses a FlySky transmitter and receiver, servos for control surfaces, a BLDC motor for propulsion, and an ESC for motor control. The airframe is constructed using Depron foam, making it lightweight and durable.

## Components

- FlySky transmitter and receiver
- BLDC motor
- Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)
- Servo motors
- Depron foam sheets
- Control horns and linkages
- Propeller
- Battery (suitable for BLDC motor)
- Charger for the battery
- Landing gear
- Adhesives (glue, tape)
- Carbon rods or wooden spars (for reinforcement)

## Parts of the Plane

- **Fuselage**: The main body of the plane, housing the electronics and battery.
- **Wings**: Provide lift and stability during flight.
- **Tail Assembly**: Includes the horizontal stabilizer and vertical fin for controlling pitch and yaw.
- **Control Surfaces**: Elevators, ailerons, and rudder controlled by servos.
- **Motor Mount**: Holds the BLDC motor in place.
- **Landing Gear**: Supports the plane during takeoff and landing.

## Assembly Instructions

1. **Build the Fuselage**:
   - Cut and assemble the Depron foam sheets to form the fuselage.
   - Reinforce with carbon rods or wooden spars as needed.

2. **Attach the Wings**:
   - Construct the wings using Depron foam and reinforce with spars.
   - Attach the wings to the fuselage securely.

3. **Install the Tail Assembly**:
   - Construct the horizontal stabilizer and vertical fin.
   - Attach to the rear of the fuselage and ensure they are perpendicular to each other.

4. **Install Control Surfaces**:
   - Attach elevators, ailerons, and rudder to their respective positions.
   - Connect control horns and linkages to servos.

5. **Motor and ESC Setup**:
   - Mount the BLDC motor to the motor mount.
   - Connect the motor to the ESC and mount the ESC securely.

6. **Install Landing Gear**:
   - Attach the landing gear to the fuselage.

## Wiring Diagram

- Connect the FlySky receiver to the servos, ESC, and battery as per the wiring diagram provided in the transmitter manual.
- Ensure proper connections to avoid any malfunction during operation.

## Transmitter and Receiver Setup

- Bind the FlySky transmitter to the receiver following the instructions in the user manual.
- Configure the transmitter settings for throttle, aileron, elevator, and rudder control.

## Testing and Calibration

- Perform a range test to ensure the transmitter and receiver are communicating properly.
- Calibrate the ESC to ensure smooth throttle control.
- Check and adjust the control surfaces for proper movement and alignment.

## Usage

- Charge the battery fully before each flight.
- Perform a pre-flight check of all controls and connections.
- Fly in an open area away from obstacles and people.
